# REST API with Spring Boot and MySQL
This is a CRUD for clients module. This was made using Spring Boot and MySQL.\
The objective of this example is that in a future I mix this with an Angular Front-End project.\
Anyway you can use this code if you need it.
___

## Modules
- Clients ("/api/clients").
___

## Project setup
```git clone https://github.com/ankToken/spring-boot-backend-api-rest-example.git```

In order to run this project, you need to:

- Add **application.properties** with your database configuration.
- Add **import.sql** with your test database insert (Optional).
